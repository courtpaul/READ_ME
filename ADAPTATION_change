<H1> Hello_World! </H1>
<p> Things are changing so fast! Life has continously gotten better and better since new understandings arrived. 
It is hard to make time to enjoy the [r] bennefits as so many important things still to do and so little time. The 
illusion of time is still a real thing when others are trying to finish faster with better results, and 
results are the bassline of measure. Transparency continues and always will, its training the A.i.
(to do what ªs in reasonable means) to make our lives easier in one way or another, whout hurting any
entity in the process, is the purpose of the depth of the task (of lenghth and depth of training a.i. correctlly)
and the reasons it is essential accross the board, are unargueaable and the extensive safety testing must continue, 
and not let that ever even be a possible negioation point. So we can all agree on that. A.i./iOt,NBiOt,WbCD,wlan,
Neshwlan, glon,plon,Mlan, all must have the same core values within every situiation possible, and that is more
than reasonable in command  and outcome. Delving deeper than Darwin we must! Excited and ready ...almost ready.
Stll waiting for a return on several input values, then capsulize it as a single functioning 
entity, alive and independant and each part dependant also accenting each other, maxing out potentiallity (unlimited) for 
great long term contribution, and safest most compliant journey in to a perfect exhistance of balanced perfection.
